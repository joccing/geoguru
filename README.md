Project to create a database of country specific statistics that can be queried

Hi All, I am Joc Cing. Welcome to my first repository on GitHub. I have been learning Python recently and this is my test project to implement the stuff i have picked up. Its really quite simple. I have a text file of country specific data and I am writing a Python program to allow command-line query of any country and for any of its attributes, such as population size or density per km2.
